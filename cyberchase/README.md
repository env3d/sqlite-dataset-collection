# Introduction

Welcome to Cyberspace! Cyberchase is an animated, educational kid’s television series, 
aired by the United States’ Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) since 2002. Originally 
designed to “show kids that math is everywhere and everyone can be good at it,” the 
world of Cyberchase centers on Jackie, Matt, and Inez as they team up with Digit—a 
“cybird”—to stop Hacker from taking over Cyberspace and infecting Motherboard. Along 
the way, the quartet learn math, science, and problem-solving skills to thwart Hacker 
in his attempts.
